# Music visualizer

Realtime music visualizer written in Rust. Uses CPAL to get the audio data that's being outputted to the default output. Uses Macroquad for rendering. Currently only visualizes the audio wave.

# Planned

Add rustfft for a proper visualizer of the frequency range.

# Building
`cargo build`
